    text: Add the ComfortCameraGizmo script to your main camera. The red frustum
      represents the maximum boundaries and the blue frustum shows the comfortable
      boundaries. The small red square represents the smallest readable font size
      and the blue square represents the more comfortable readable font size.

    text: Most measurements are in meters. The units for the frustum angles are wonky
      and need to be updated for readability.
